          <h2>The Sun</h2>
          <p>
            The Sun is a massive, glowing sphere of hot plasma at the solar
            system's center, providing essential energy for life on Earth. Its
            powerful gravitational pull keeps the planets in orbit and will
            continue to burn for about another 5 billion years.

          <p>
            Mercury, the smallest and innermost planet, orbits the Sun at just
            57.9 million kilometers, experiencing extreme temperatures due to
            its thin atmosphere. It completes a swift orbit around the Sun in
            just 88 Earth days.

          <p>
            Venus, Earth's twin in size and composition, is the hottest planet
            due to its thick, toxic clouds and runaway greenhouse effect. It
            rotates slowly in the opposite direction, taking 243 Earth days for
            one rotation and 225 days to orbit the Sun.

            Mars, the Red Planet, has the largest volcano and canyon in the
            solar system and is a prime candidate for future human exploration.
            It has a thin atmosphere, seasons, polar ice caps, and occasional
            planet-wide dust storms.

            Uranus, the seventh planet, is an ice giant with a unique sideways
            rotation and a pale blue color due to its methane-rich atmosphere.
            It has a faint ring system, 27 known moons, and an extreme axial
            tilt causing unusual seasonal variations.
